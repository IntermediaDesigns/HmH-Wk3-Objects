    <h1>Objects!</h1>

    <p class="para">
      Objects are terrific at describing things in code. They are similar to an
      array in that it's a collection of values but, unlike an array, it is a
      collection of values that describes one 'thing'. <br /><br />
      Here's a person who likes dogs and laptops represented as an object:
    </p>

    <p id="arrayList"></p>

    <div id="buttonList">
      <!--Make 4 buttons-->
      <!--1st button "Buy a Dog!"
                            Displays "You need a $100 to buy a dog." under buttons. When you earn money, per each $100, you buy 1 dog and it updates dogs array and decreases money buy $ amount used-->
      <button class="buyDog">Buy a Dog!</button>

      <!--2nd button "Dog dies.."
                            Displays "You don't have a dog, it couldn't of died." After you buy a dog, the dogs array decreases by 1-->
      <button class="death">Dog dies..</button>

      <!--3rd "work to earn Money!"
                            Adds $100 each click to the money array-->
      <button class="work">work to earn Money!</button>

      <!--4th "Buy a new laptop!"
                            Displays "You need $1000 to buy a laptop." under button. When you earn money, per each $1000, you buy 1 laptop and it updates laptops array and decreases money buy $ amount used -->
      <button class="laptop">Buy a new laptop!</button>
    </div>

    <p id="display"></p>
