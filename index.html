    <h1>Objects!</h1>
    
    <p class="para">
      Objects are terrific at describing things in code. They are similar to an
      array in that it's a collection of values but, unlike an array, it is a
      collection of values that describes one 'thing'. <br /><br />
      Here's a person who likes dogs and laptops represented as an object:
    </p>

    <p id="arrayList"></p>

    <div id="buttonList">
      <!--Make 4 buttons-->
      <!--1st button "Buy a Dog!"
                            Displays "You need a $100 to buy a dog." under buttons-->
      <button class="buyDog">Buy a Dog!</button>

      <!--2nd button "Add a random number"
                            Adds a random number to the current generated array list including from any button pressed-->
      <button class="death">Dog dies..</button>

      <!--3rd "bear emoji"
                            Changes all numbers to bears but adds a random number to current bear list, remove a number will only remove numbers not bears, fizzbuzz does not do anything, alert pops up when clicking heart button and says "Super bonus hearts can only be performed with an array of all numbers. Please reset!" (bug currently for resetting after clicking heart with full bears)-->
      <button class="work">work to earn Money!</button>

      <!--4th "Reverse It!"
                            Reverses all the numbers in the array-->
      <button class="laptop">Buy a new laptop!</button>

    </div>

    <p id="display"></p>
    
  </body>
</html>
